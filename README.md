#  Apple Clone Project

A collaborative front-end development exercise inspired by Appleâ€™s official homepage. This project was developed by six teams to practice modern web development workflows, Git collaboration, and responsive design principles.

##  Project Overview

The **Apple Clone Project** replicates the layout and aesthetic of [apple.com](https://www.apple.com), focusing on:
- Clean and minimalist design
- Responsive structure across devices
- Modular and maintainable code organization
- Interactive elements using JavaScript and jQuery

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€“ Semantic structure and layout
- **CSS3** â€“ Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6)** â€“ Dynamic behavior and interactivity
- **jQuery** â€“ Simplified DOM manipulation and animations
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control and team collaboration

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Collaboration

This project was developed by six GitHub contributors working in parallel teams:

| GitHub Username | Role |

## Git Command Notes with Explanations

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Alebachew424/appleClonee.git
> Downloads the project from GitHub to your local machine.

# Navigate into the project folder
cd appleClonee
> Moves into the cloned project directory.

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b <branch-name>
> Creates a new branch and switches to it. Replace <branch-name> with your assigned section name.

# Stage all changes
git add .
> Prepares all modified files to be committed.

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"
> Saves your staged changes with a descriptive message.

# Pull latest changes from main branch
git pull origin main
> Updates your local branch with the latest changes from the remote main branch to avoid conflicts.

# Push your branch to GitHub
git push -u origin <branch-name>
> Uploads your branch and commits to GitHub. The -u flag sets the upstream so future pushes can be done with just git push.

# Resolve merge conflicts (if needed)
> A merge conflict happens when two branches modify the same part of a file. Git marks the conflict like this:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your version
=======
Teammateâ€™s version
>>>>>>> branch-name

> To fix:
1. Manually edit the file to choose or combine the correct code.
2. Save the file.
3. Stage and commit the resolved file:
   git add <filename>
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in <filename>"
   git push origin <branch-name>

# Revert a faulty commit
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
> Reverts a specific commit safely without deleting history. It creates a new commit that undoes the changes from the specified commit.
