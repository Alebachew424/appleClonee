#  Apple Clone Project

A collaborative front-end development exercise inspired by Appleâ€™s official homepage. This project was developed by six teams to practice modern web development workflows, Git collaboration, and responsive design principles.

##  Project Overview

The **Apple Clone Project** replicates the layout and aesthetic of [apple.com](https://www.apple.com), focusing on:
- Clean and minimalist design
- Responsive structure across devices
- Modular and maintainable code organization
- Interactive elements using JavaScript and jQuery

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€“ Semantic structure and layout
- **CSS3** â€“ Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6)** â€“ Dynamic behavior and interactivity
- **jQuery** â€“ Simplified DOM manipulation and animations
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control and team collaboration
